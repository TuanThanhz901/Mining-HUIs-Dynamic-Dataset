    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the <strong>High Utility Itemset Miner</strong>! This
      application is designed to help researchers, data analysts, and business
      professionals efficiently mine high utility itemsets from data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website was developed by <strong>Le Tuan Thanh</strong> and
      <strong>Pham Hoang Trung Kien</strong>, a student from the Faculty of
      <strong>Information Technology, Ton Duc Thang University</strong>. It is a
      demo project for the Information Technology Project course, under the
      guidance of <strong>Mr. Doan Xuan Thanh</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this website is to explore high occupancy itemsets by using
      the IMEFIM algorithm:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Interleaved pattern mining with
        <strong>Efficient Frequent Itemset Mining (IMEFIM).</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      IMEFIM was introduced by Loan T.T. Nguyen and other co-authors in 2019. It
      utilizes advanced interleaving techniques to discover high occupancy
      itemsets efficiently. However, you may encounter difficulties in selecting
      the most suitable minimum occupancy threshold to determine the correct
      number of itemsets.
    </p>
    <h2>Provide</h2>
    <p>The website provides the following functions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mine high occupancy itemsets using the IMEFIM algorithm.</li>
      <li>Allow users to upload datasets and adjust utility thresholds.</li>
      <li>Display and interpret mining results for analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Format of source file</h2>
    <p>
      The input file is a text file containing transaction data. Each line
      represents a transaction, where items are separated by spaces, followed by
      the total utility value (profit) separated by a colon. The individual
      utilities of items in the transaction are also separated by spaces and are
      listed after the total utility, separated by another colon.
    </p>
    <h2>Format of returned file</h2>
    <p>
      The returned file is a text file containing the high occupancy itemsets
      mined from the input data. Each line represents an itemset and its
      corresponding utility value, separated by a space. Items in the itemset
      are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.
